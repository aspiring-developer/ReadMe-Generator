# README-Generator
**Generates a file and inserts user's inputs - node.js and ES6.**
- This app randomly generates a read me file based on user's input. User is asked to enter Github user name and some other information, then as soon as all information entered, the read me file will populate with the user's Github profile picture, a badge and entered information.
- The gif file demonstrates a little functionality of this app.
- The index.js file is used to receive user input and other files are dependents.
- The dynamically updated ReadMe file is located inside the Develop folder.
